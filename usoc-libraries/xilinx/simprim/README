=====================README========================
This README file was added to this directory to explain the addition of 
the following files:
simprim_VITAL_mti.vhd
simprim_Vcomponents_mti.vhd
simprim_Vpackage_mti.vhd
simprim_SMODEL_mti.vhd

In software releases prior to the 6.1i software, these files did not 
exist.  These files have been added to this release to workaround an 
issue with mapping to the Vital2000 library.  ModelTech compiles 
Vital2000 into a separate Vital2000 library. All of the other supported
simulators compile Vital2000 into the IEEE library.

The 6.1i SIMPRIM models use Vital2000 constructs and therefore the 
SIMPRIM models must call the Vital2000 library.  In order to call the 
Vital2000 library for ModelSim, the following library declarations must 
be used:
Library VITAL2000;
use VITAL2000.VITAL_Primitives.all
use VITAL2000.VITAL_Timing.all

For all of the other supported simulators, the following declarations are 
used:
Library IEEE;
use IEEE.VITAL_Primitives.all
use IEEE.VITAL_Timing.all

It was therefore necessary to create a separate set of libraries for 
ModelSim.  Except for the Library declarations shown above, the "_mti" 
files are identical to the corresponding files without the "_mti".

COMPXLIB will automatically compile the "_mti" files when ModelSim is 
selected as the simulator and will use the other files when any 
other simulator is selected.  If compiling the models manually, the 
"_mti" files must be used with the ModelSim simulator and the other 
files are used for any other simulator.
