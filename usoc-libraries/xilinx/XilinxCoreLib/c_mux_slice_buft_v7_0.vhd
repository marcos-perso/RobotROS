Library IEEE;
Use IEEE.std_logic_1164.all;

-- 1*m to 1*m tristate (used as a bus mux)

entity C_MUX_SLICE_BUFT_V7_0 is

		  T 	: in std_logic := '0'; -- Output/Tristate ('0'/'1')
		  O 	: out std_logic_vector(C_WIDTH-1 downto 0)); -- Registered output value

end C_MUX_SLICE_BUFT_V7_0;

architecture behavioral of C_MUX_SLICE_BUFT_V7_0 is
